# MyDiscoverSpending
Detailed Python Data Analysis over my spending from Febrauary 2023 through January 2024.<br />
I dive deep into where most of my spending is going per month and where I can make the biggest change in my spending habits.<br />
This leads me to analyzing my spending at supermarkets over a 12 month timeframe.<br />
<b>Performed data cleaning using python pandas and data visualizations using python GUI's and external libraries</b><br />
For a more detailed analysis please read my *spend.py* file. I left detailed comments and visualizations to explain my spending habits.<br />
