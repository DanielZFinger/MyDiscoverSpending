# MyDiscoverSpending
Detailed Python Data Analysis over my spending from Febrauary 2023 through January 2024.
I dive deep into where most of my spending is going per month and where I can make the biggest change in my spending habits.
This leads me to analyzing my spending habits at supermarkets over 12 months and how it has changed and asking why it increased during certain months as opposed to others.
For a more detailed analysis please read my spend.py file. I left detailed comments and visualizations to explain my spending habits.
